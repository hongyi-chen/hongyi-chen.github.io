    <p>Dear Shopify, 🧑🏻‍💻 </p>
    <p>I'm applying for your <span>UX Developer</span> and <span>Web Developer</span> roles! 
      As an entrepreneur, I have witnessed first-hand the ability that Shopify has to revolutionize commerce. 
      This has not only impacted me directly, but also <span>inspires</span> me. 
      The <span>culture, people, and products</span> that makes Shopify so great is something I'd love to contribute to.</p>
    <p>Since I was 16, I've worked at numerous companies and learned a lot about technical products — <span>I hope Shopify can be the next chapter</span>.</p>

    <p>I've curated a few of my past/current projects to highlight my <span>front-end development and design skills</span>. Feel free to checkout my <a target="blank" href="https://github.com/hongyi-chen">Github</a> and my <a href="Hong Yi Chen Resume.pdf" target="_blank">resume</a> for more projects.</p>
    <p>Let me join you on your mission of <span>making commerce better for everyone</span>.</p>
    <p>
      - Hong Yi
