    <h1>to: tech+ mentorship</h1>
    <p>Dear Tech+ Mentorship Organizing Team, 🧑🏻‍💻 </p>
    <p>I'm applying for your <span>Organizer</span> and <span>Tools Developer</span> roles! 
      As a mentee myself, I have witnessed first-hand the ability that Tech+ Mentorship has to empower young individuals with a network and opportunities for the future.
      This has not only impacted me directly, but also inspires me. 
      The supportive culture, mentees and mentors, and events that makes Tech+ Mentorship so great is something I'd love to contribute to.</p>
    <p>Through my experiences, I've learned a lot about creating great experiences for others — <span>I aspire to do exactly that on the Tech+ Mentorship team</span>.</p>

    <p>I've curated a few of my past/current projects to highlight my <span>event planning, teamwork, and business</span> skills. Feel free to checkout my <a target="blank" href="https://github.com/hongyi-chen"><dotted>Github</dotted></a> and my <a href="Hong Yi Chen Resume.pdf" target="_blank">resume</a> for more projects.</p>
    <p>I hope to join you on this mission of <span>creating a more diverse and inclusive tech community at UWaterloo</span>.</p>
